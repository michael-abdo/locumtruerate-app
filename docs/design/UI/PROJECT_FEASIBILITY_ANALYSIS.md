## Feasibility Assessment

### With $4,700 Budget - Realistic Deliverables

#### MUST HAVE (MVP - 70% budget)
1. Basic authentication (login/register)
2. Contract calculator with core calculations
3. Simple job board (list view only)
4. Basic recruiter posting capability
5. Minimal admin user management
6. Database for users and jobs

#### SHOULD HAVE (20% budget)
1. Paycheck calculator
2. Card view for job board
3. Basic search functionality
4. User profile pages

#### NICE TO HAVE (10% budget)
1. Advanced filtering
2. Analytics dashboards
3. Email notifications
4. Export features

### Time/Budget Reality Check

**Honest Assessment**: The full scope as described in the job posting would typically be a $15,000-25,000 project requiring 2-3 months with a small team.

**For $4,700 in 1 month**, you can deliver:
- A functional MVP with core features
- Professional UI (leveraging existing design)
- Basic but working calculators
- Simple job board functionality
- Essential user management

**What will be compromised**:
- Limited analytics features
- Basic filtering instead of advanced
- Manual processes instead of full automation
- Minimal email integration
- Simple dashboard views

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Scope Creep**: Define clear MVP boundaries upfront
2. **Technical Complexity**: Use proven libraries/frameworks
3. **Timeline Pressure**: Focus on core features first
4. **Testing Time**: Implement CI/CD early
5. **Client Expectations**: Weekly demos to align vision

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Core Functionality
Focus on getting the calculators and basic authentication working. This demonstrates immediate value.

### Phase 2 (Week 3): Job Board MVP
Implement basic job posting and viewing without complex features.

### Phase 3 (Week 4): Integration & Polish
Connect features, add essential dashboards, test thoroughly.

### Post-Launch Phase 2 Contract
Propose additional features as Phase 2 for additional budget.

## Conclusion

**Can one developer complete this in 1 month for $4,700?** 
YES, but only as an MVP with core features. Set clear expectations about what's included.

**Recommended Stack for Speed**:
- Next.js 14 (React + API routes)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel or Cloudflare deployment
- Claude Code for accelerated development

**Success Factors**:
1. Clear scope definition upfront
2. Reuse existing UI patterns from demo
3. Focus on calculator accuracy first
4. Simple but functional job board
5. Plan for Phase 2 enhancements
