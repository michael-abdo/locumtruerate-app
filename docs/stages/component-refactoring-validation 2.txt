- Component Refactoring Validation - Prove 85% Target is Achievable
  - Phase 1: Button Component POC (Highest Impact, Lowest Risk)
    - Document current Button state for baseline comparison
      - Run analyzer with verbose output to capture current 62.5% score
      - Save detailed pattern analysis showing web-specific issues
      - Identify specific className and onClick patterns causing low score
    - Refactor Button component to cross-platform patterns
      - Replace className prop with style objects for React Native compatibility
      - Abstract onClick to onPress with platform detection
      - Remove web-specific HTML attributes and CSS classes
      - Test component still works correctly in demo environment
    - Validate improvement with analyzer
      - Run analyzer again with verbose output
      - Compare before/after scores to confirm improvement
      - Target: Button score should increase from 62.5% to 85%+
      - Document specific patterns that were fixed
    - Document refactoring patterns for team scaling
      - Create refactoring guide based on Button POC experience
      - List common web-to-mobile pattern replacements
      - Document testing approach for validating changes
  - Phase 2: Scale to Remaining Components (Only if POC Succeeds)
    - Apply Button patterns to Input component (currently 57.1%)
      - Use same refactoring approach from Button POC
      - Target 85%+ cross-platform reusability score
      - Validate functionality in demo environment
    - Apply Button patterns to Modal component (currently 57.1%)
      - Use same refactoring approach from Button POC
      - Target 85%+ cross-platform reusability score
      - Validate modal behavior works correctly
    - Run comprehensive analyzer check on all 6 components
      - Verify overall average meets or exceeds 85% target
      - Confirm baseline check passes in CI
      - Update baseline.json with new improved scores
  - Phase 3: Production Integration (Only After Validation)
    - Update CI baseline with improved component scores
      - Modify baseline.json to reflect new higher standards
      - Test CI fails correctly if components regress below new thresholds
      - Document new baseline as minimum acceptable scores
    - Create component improvement documentation
      - Document successful refactoring patterns
      - Create guidelines for future cross-platform development
      - Add to team knowledge base for scaling mobile development
