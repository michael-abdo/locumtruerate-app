- Analyzer Fix - Next Steps (Senior Engineer Approach)
  - Immediate (This Week) - Ship What Works
    - Ship analyzer fix to production (30 min)
      - Merge the changes to main branch
      - Update any deployment configs if needed
      - Verify analyzer works correctly in production environment
      - Test CLI tool with production data
    - Add basic CI check (45 min)
      - Create npm script that runs the analyzer on demo components
      - Configure script to fail if any component drops below current baseline
      - Add to CI pipeline to prevent regression
      - Test CI check works correctly
  - Next (Only After Shipping) - Validate and Improve
    - Use the accurate metrics for component prioritization (1 hour)
      - Prioritize the 3 components below 85% target (button, input, modal)
      - Refactor one component as proof-of-concept (start with button.tsx)
      - Validate the improvement shows correctly in analyzer metrics
      - Document refactoring patterns for team
  - Later (If Still Relevant) - Mobile Preparation
    - Consider mobile preparation tasks
      - Only proceed after analyzer fix proven in production
      - Focus on components that already meet 85% threshold
      - Use accurate baseline for mobile development planning
      - Avoid scope creep until core value is delivered
