#####Our Tech Stack#####

Frontend:

Cloudflare Pages (for hosting)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (from your existing calculator)
Optional: React, Vue, or other frontend frameworks if you want to expand the UI


Backend:

Cloudflare Workers (serverless JavaScript/TypeScript functions)
Organized as multiple Workers for different API endpoints (auth, calculations, job board)


Database:

Cloudflare D1 (serverless SQL database)
Automatically encrypted at rest using AES-256
Perfect for user profiles, saved calculations, and job listings


Storage for resume files or media:

Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible object storage)
Great for storing resumes, profile pictures, and other binary files
No egress fees, unlike AWS S3


Auth:

Cloudflare Access (for admin access)
Custom JWT implementation in Workers (for user authentication)
Or Cloudflare Zero Trust if your budget allows for enterprise features


Additional Cloudflare Services:

Workers KV (for caching and session management)
Durable Objects (for maintaining state when needed)
Images API (for image optimization/resizing)
