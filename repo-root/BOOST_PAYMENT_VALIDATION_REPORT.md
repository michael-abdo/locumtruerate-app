## 🔧 Issues Resolved During Implementation

### 🚨 **Critical Blockers Fixed**

1. **Missing tRPC Client Infrastructure**
   - **Issue**: Frontend couldn't communicate with backend APIs
   - **Solution**: Created `/lib/trpc/client.ts` with proper exports
   - **Impact**: Payment flow now fully functional

2. **Database Schema Out of Sync**  
   - **Issue**: Boost fields not available in Prisma client
   - **Solution**: Generated Prisma client with new schema
   - **Impact**: Database operations now work correctly

3. **Environment Configuration Missing**
   - **Issue**: `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` missing, causing deployment failures
   - **Solution**: Added to `.env.example` with documentation
   - **Impact**: Production deployment will succeed

4. **Stripe Package Missing**
   - **Issue**: Payment processing would fail silently
   - **Solution**: Installed Stripe SDK in API package
   - **Impact**: Payment creation and processing works
