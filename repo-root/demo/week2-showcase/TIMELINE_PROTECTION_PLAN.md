**Risk Level**: HIGH - Fixed deadline

## Dependency Mapping

### Immediate Dependencies (Week 3 Start)
1. **tRPC Version Conflict Resolution** 
   - Blocker: `@tanstack/react-query` version mismatch
   - Owner: DevOps/Backend Team
   - Timeline: Day 1-2 of Week 3
   - Buffer: +1 day

2. **Clerk Authentication Integration**
   - Blocker: Legal pages need public access
   - Owner: Frontend Team  
   - Timeline: Day 2-3 of Week 3
   - Buffer: +1 day

3. **Component Re-integration**
   - Blocker: Demo components ‚Üí Production app
   - Owner: Frontend Team
   - Timeline: Day 3-4 of Week 3
   - Buffer: +1 day

### Sequential Dependencies (Week 3-6)

#### Week 3 ‚Üí Week 4
- **Requirement**: Calculator foundation stable
- **Risk**: If Week 3 slips, Week 4 features at risk
- **Mitigation**: Parallel development of advanced features

#### Week 4 ‚Üí Week 5  
- **Requirement**: Core calculator features complete
- **Risk**: Production integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Staged deployment strategy

#### Week 5 ‚Üí Week 6
- **Requirement**: Full feature set validated
- **Risk**: Launch deadline fixed
- **Mitigation**: Feature prioritization for MVP

## Buffer Time Allocation

### Week 3 Buffer Strategy
```
Planned Development: 5 days
Buffer Allocation: 2 days  
Total Available: 7 days
Buffer Ratio: 40%

Day 1-2: Dependency resolution (1 day buffer)
Day 3-4: Component integration (1 day buffer)  
Day 5-7: Calculator development (0 days buffer - critical)
```

### Week 4-6 Buffer Strategy
```
Week 4: 6 planned + 1 buffer = 7 days (17% buffer)
Week 5: 6 planned + 1 buffer = 7 days (17% buffer)  
Week 6: 5 planned + 0 buffer = 5 days (0% buffer - launch fixed)

Total Project Buffer: 4 days across 4 weeks (15% total)
```

### Buffer Utilization Rules
1. **Green Zone** (0-50% buffer used): Continue as planned
2. **Yellow Zone** (50-80% buffer used): Daily standups, remove nice-to-haves
3. **Red Zone** (80-100% buffer used): Escalate, consider scope reduction
4. **Critical Zone** (100%+ buffer used): Emergency protocol, stakeholder decisions

## Alternative Approaches by Risk Level

### High-Risk Scenario: tRPC Integration Fails
**Alternative 1**: Keep demo separate, iframe embedding
```typescript
// Main app integration via iframe
<iframe 
  src="http://demo-env.locumtruerate.com/calculator" 
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '600px' }}
/>
```

**Alternative 2**: Manual code merge without demo environment
```bash
# Copy components manually, fix dependencies in-place
cp demo/week2-showcase/src/components/* apps/web/src/components/
# Manual dependency resolution
```

**Alternative 3**: Hybrid approach - Legal pages only
```typescript
// Integrate only low-risk static components
const LegalPages = process.env.USE_DEMO_LEGAL ? DemoLegalPages : OriginalLegalPages;
```

### Medium-Risk Scenario: Calculator Development Delays
**Alternative 1**: MVP Calculator (basic only)
```typescript
// Simplified calculator with essential features only
interface BasicCalculator {
  hourlyRate: number;
  hoursPerWeek: number;
  deductions: number;
  result: number;
}
```

**Alternative 2**: Wizard approach (phased release)
```typescript
// Release in phases
Phase 1: Basic rate calculation
Phase 2: Advanced deductions  
Phase 3: Comparison tools
```

**Alternative 3**: External calculator integration
```typescript
// Integrate existing calculator temporarily
<iframe src="https://external-calculator.com/embed" />
```

### Low-Risk Scenario: Polish and Enhancement Delays
**Alternative 1**: Launch with basic styling
**Alternative 2**: Progressive enhancement post-launch
**Alternative 3**: Community feedback iteration
