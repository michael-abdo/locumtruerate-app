## üö® Security Best Practices

### Database Configuration
```sql
-- Enable audit logging
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'all';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_connections = 'on';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_disconnections = 'on';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_checkpoints = 'on';

-- SSL configuration
ALTER SYSTEM SET ssl = 'on';
ALTER SYSTEM SET ssl_min_protocol_version = 'TLSv1.2';
```
