## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Environment Variable Errors
```bash
# Issue: Missing DATABASE_URL
# Solution: Add to .env.local
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname" >> .env.local
```

#### Database Connection Errors
```bash
# Issue: PostgreSQL not running
sudo systemctl start postgresql

# Issue: Database doesn't exist
sudo -u postgres createdb locumtruerate_dev

# Issue: Connection refused
# Check if PostgreSQL is listening on port 5432
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 5432
```

#### Page Loading Test Failures
```bash
# Issue: Port already in use
# Solution: Stop other Next.js processes
pkill -f "next"

# Issue: Build errors
# Solution: Clear and rebuild
rm -rf apps/web/.next
pnpm build
```

#### Package Compilation Errors
```bash
# Issue: TypeScript errors
# Solution: Fix type issues or skip lib check
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck

# Issue: Missing dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Test Environment Variables

For testing purposes, you can set these environment variables:

```bash
# Skip certain tests
export SKIP_PAGE_TEST=true
export SKIP_DB_TEST=true

# Test with production-like settings
export NODE_ENV=production
export ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGS=false

# Test with development settings  
export NODE_ENV=development
export ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGS=true
```
