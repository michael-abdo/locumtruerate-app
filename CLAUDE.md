## Task-to-Document Mapping

### Understanding Requirements
**PRIMARY DOCUMENT:** perspectives/final_features_perspective.md
**SECTIONS:** Core Features, Expected Behavior, User Interface

### System Architecture
**PRIMARY DOCUMENT:** perspectives/abstract_perspective.md
**SECTIONS:** Core Infrastructure, Process Flow, Key Components

### Implementation Details
**PRIMARY DOCUMENT:** perspectives/implementation_perspective.md
**SECTIONS:** Technology Stack, Tool Details, Implementation Guidelines

## Critical Rules and Patterns

1. **Priority Hierarchy**: Final Features > Abstract > Implementation
2. **Consensus Required**: All changes must maintain alignment across perspectives
3. **Documentation First**: Update perspectives before implementing changes
