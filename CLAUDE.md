## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINT
**ðŸš¨ MOBILE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENT ðŸš¨**

**EVERYTHING MUST BE BUILT WITH MOBILE DEPLOYMENT IN MIND**

All code, components, APIs, and architectural decisions must be designed from the ground up to support:
- **Cross-platform deployment** (Web + iOS + Android)
- **Shared TypeScript codebase** (â‰¥80% code reuse target)
- **TurboRepo monorepo structure** for seamless mobile integration
- **React Native compatibility** for all UI components
- **Universal API design** that works identically on web and mobile

**Implementation Rules:**
1. Use **React components** that can be adapted for React Native
2. Design **responsive layouts** that work on mobile screens first
3. Create **shared business logic** in pure TypeScript packages
4. Avoid **web-only APIs** or browser-specific features
5. Plan **data structures** and **API endpoints** for mobile consumption
6. Use **cross-platform compatible** libraries and patterns

This is not just a web application - it's the foundation for a full cross-platform LocumTrueRate.com ecosystem.

## Project Overview
This project was created using the Triangulated Perspectives Constructor methodology and is being developed as LocumTrueRate.com - a comprehensive locum tenens platform.

## Task-to-Document Mapping

### Understanding Requirements
**PRIMARY DOCUMENT:** perspectives/final_features_perspective.md
**SECTIONS:** Core Features, Expected Behavior, User Interface

### System Architecture
**PRIMARY DOCUMENT:** perspectives/abstract_perspective.md
**SECTIONS:** Core Infrastructure, Process Flow, Key Components

### Implementation Details
**PRIMARY DOCUMENT:** perspectives/implementation_perspective.md
**SECTIONS:** Technology Stack, Tool Details, Implementation Guidelines

## Critical Rules and Patterns

1. **Priority Hierarchy**: Final Features > Abstract > Implementation
2. **Consensus Required**: All changes must maintain alignment across perspectives
3. **Documentation First**: Update perspectives before implementing changes
