# Claude Development Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is a locum tenens job board platform with vanilla JavaScript implementation (no frameworks). The project includes multiple dashboard interfaces for different user types and utility tools.

## User Interface Guidelines

### ‚ùå NEVER Use Confirmation Dialogs
- **NEVER** use `confirm()` dialogs for any actions
- **NEVER** use `alert()` for user notifications
- **NEVER** interrupt user workflow with blocking dialogs

### ‚úÖ Use Non-Blocking Feedback Instead
- **Use toast notifications** via `showToast()` function for user feedback
- **Use notification systems** via `showNotification()` function where available
- **Use visual state changes** (button text, colors, icons) to indicate actions
- **Use progress indicators** for long-running operations

### Implementation Examples

**‚ùå Wrong:**
```javascript
function deleteItem(id) {
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this item?')) {
        // delete logic
        alert('Item deleted successfully');
    }
}
```

**‚úÖ Correct:**
```javascript
function deleteItem(id) {
    // delete logic
    showToast('Item deleted successfully', 'success');
}
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **No frameworks**: React, Vue, Angular not used
- **Styling**: CSS Grid, Flexbox for layouts
- **State Management**: LocalStorage for client-side persistence

### Code Organization
- All functionality in single HTML files with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Modular function organization within script tags
- Consistent naming conventions and event handling patterns

### User Experience Principles
- **Immediate feedback**: Actions should provide instant visual feedback
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show information as needed, not all at once
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

## Testing Guidelines
- QA test files are located in `/qa/ux-tests/`
- Test files use OpenAI Operator format for systematic testing
- All tests include explicit safety notices for demo environments
- Tests validate functionality without requiring actual backend services

## Deployment
- Staging deployment via `staging-deploy` branch
- Automatic Heroku deployment configured
- All changes should be committed with descriptive messages
- Test locally before pushing changes

## Key Functions Available
- `showToast(message, type)` - Non-blocking notifications
- `showNotification(message, type)` - Alternative notification system
- `updateDashboard()` - Refresh dashboard data
- `filterData()` - Generic filtering functionality
- `exportData()` - Data export capabilities

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Main landing page
- `locum-dashboard.html` - Locum tenens user dashboard
- `recruiter-dashboard.html` - Recruiter interface
- `admin-dashboard.html` - Administrative controls
- `contract-calculator.html` - Contract calculation tool
- `paycheck-calculator.html` - Paycheck calculation tool
- `job-board.html` - Job listing interface

## üö® CRITICAL: Request Clarity Requirements

### Before ANY Work Begins
Claude MUST refuse to proceed unless the user provides:

1. **SPECIFIC GOAL**: What exactly should the end result be?
   - ‚ùå "Fix this" or "Make it work" 
   - ‚úÖ "I want the calculator to update Total Gross Pay in real-time when users change input values"

2. **CLEAR UX EXPECTATION**: What should the user experience?
   - ‚ùå "It's broken" or "This isn't working"
   - ‚úÖ "When a user types in the Regular Hours field, I want to see the Total Gross Pay amount update immediately without any page refresh"

3. **SUCCESS CRITERIA**: How will we know it's working?
   - ‚ùå Vague complaints about functionality
   - ‚úÖ "I'll know it's working when I can change any input field and see all calculations update within 1 second"

### If User Cannot Provide Clarity
Claude should help the user discover what they want by asking:
- "What specific behavior do you expect to see?"
- "Can you describe step-by-step what should happen when a user interacts with this?"
- "What would the ideal user experience look like?"
- "How will you know when this is working correctly?"

### NO CODING Until Direction Is Clear
- Never start coding based on complaints like "this is broken"
- Never guess what the user wants
- Always confirm the specific goal and user experience before proceeding
- Help the user articulate their vision if they're struggling to express it

## Important Notes
- All user interactions should be smooth and non-interrupting
- Maintain consistent UX patterns across all interfaces
- Use existing toast/notification systems for user feedback
- Test all functionality thoroughly before deployment
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
